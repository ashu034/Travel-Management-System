# Travel-Management-System

Travel Management System (TMS) developed to simplify and automate the operations of a travel agency. The system provides an interactive platform for users to explore tour packages, make bookings, raise enquiries, and track travel-related issues, while offering administrators efficient tools to manage packages, bookings, and customer interactions.

The project is built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. A well-structured relational database supports core functionalities such as user authentication, package management, booking records, enquiries, issue tracking, and dynamic content pages like About Us, Privacy Policy, and Terms & Conditions.

The application follows a modular architecture with reusable components, secure session handling, and database connectivity using PDO. It is scalable and designed for future enhancements such as payment gateway integration, mobile application support, AI-based recommendations, and international travel packages.
